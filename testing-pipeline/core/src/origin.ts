/**
 * Where a failure comes from (ARCHITECTURE.md section 10, step 5). Each check
 * a branch fails under a class setting and setup is said to come from:
 *
 * - `class`: the branch does not fail it under the reference (article with
 *   setup A). It is new under this class setting or setup. When the solo
 *   branch of one of its steps fails it here too, the class breaks that way
 *   wherever it sits, and the check names the node.
 * - `way`: the branch fails it under the reference too, and the solo branch of
 *   one of its steps (`plan.ts`) fails it as well: the way fails on its
 *   own, wherever it sits. A defect of the way, counted once per way and not
 *   against every place it is tested in.
 * - `document`: the log could not tie it to the branch (a `:document`
 *   failure: a page that overflowed, labels that changed). Any branch of the
 *   document may have caused it, until the explainer separates them (step 6).
 * - `nesting`: none of these. The branch fails it where it sits, and its ways
 *   alone do not.
 *
 * A check is a failure's `check` without the `:document` suffix. A branch's
 * origin is its worst check's: nesting, class, document, then way.
