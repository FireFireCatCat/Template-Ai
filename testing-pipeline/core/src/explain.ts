/**
 * The explainer (ARCHITECTURE.md section 5, stage 7; ../ARCHITECTURE.md 4.6):
 * from a failure the matrix shows to a candidate rule with a minimal
 * reproducer.
 *
 * Failures are grouped by what they say (the check and the shape of its
 * evidence), where they were seen (the class setting and setup, for a failure
 * new under a class; the reference, for one the branch shows there too) and,
 * when the log tied the failure to its branch, the branch's chain of nodes and
 * its leaf's way. A failure the way shows alone needs no trial: its solo
 * branch is the reproducer (`soloExplanations`). One branch stands for each
 * other group and is explained by trials: small documents compiled through
 * the store like any other, so explaining again compiles nothing.
 *
 * 0. A failure the log could not tie to a branch is first tried on a document
 *    holding no branch: one that shows it there comes from the host's own
 *    preamble under that class, whatever the document holds.
 * 1. Which branches it takes. The branch alone; if it passes alone, the
 *    fewest of its document's other branches that bring the failure back,
 *    found by halving as Flouest's `limits.ts` does. A failure the log could
 *    not tie to a branch is halved over the whole document. Two branches give
 *    a combination rule. More that cannot be halved further give a limit: the
 *    document's mass, not a pair.
 * 2. The shortest chain. Every legal chain made from the one branch by
 *    dropping steps (each kept step keeping its variant and, while it still
 *    fits, its member) is tried, shortest first; the first that still fails is
 *    the reproducer, and its last step is the rule's child. A node that fails
 *    alone at the top is its way's own: a defect, or, when the reference
 *    passes it, a class rule.
 * 3. What matters about the parent. Its node's other variants and its
 *    variant's other members are tried in its place, and the child's other
 *    members in the child's. Values every failing member shares and no
 *    passing one has become the rule's `when`. A node above the parent
 *    matters when one of its other variants passes; one that does not is
 *    there only to make the place legal, and the rule's scope stays direct.
 * 4. A way that works there. The child node's other variants are tried in its
 *    place; the first that passes is the fallback, else the rule denies.
 * 5. Where it holds. A rule found under another class setting is tried under
 *    the reference; when the reference passes it, the rule is that class
 *    setting's.
 *
 * Adapts, and dropping one package of a way, need what the interim library
 * cannot give (a way's adapt candidates, its packages as parts); they come
 * with the library's keys. Trying a node's other variants covers its other
 * package sets.
