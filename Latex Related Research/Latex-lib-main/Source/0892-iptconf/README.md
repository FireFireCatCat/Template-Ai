# iptconf — Document class for IPT conference proceedings

The `iptconf` class provides a two-column, A4 document layout for papers
submitted to the annual conference of the Institute of Physics and
Technology (IPT / НН ФТІ) at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.

The class supports Ukrainian, Russian and English as the paper language;
automatically writes a speaker registration form (`.txt`) and structured
article metadata (`.yaml`) as side effects of `\PaperLanguage`; and
exports per-paper title/author data to a `.dat` auxiliary file suitable
for building a book-of-abstracts index.

The class requires LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX for full functionality;
pdfLaTeX is supported with reduced font features.
